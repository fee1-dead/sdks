# Documentation Templates
The purpose of providing documentation templates is to fast track the documentation process of your SDK. You should only provide code examples for each of the provided user story and those examples will be embedded in our [documentation website](https://docs.onflow.org/).

## Usage
Clone `template.md` file and insert all examples and references marked with `// TODO`. Please be aware it is highly encourage you generate an API specification using best practices in the SDK imeplementation language (jsdocs for js, javadoc for java, godoc for go etc.). Feel free to add language specific text but try to keep it minimal because the idea is that explanation of concepts are langauge generic you should only provide langauge specific examples.
