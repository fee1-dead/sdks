# Flow SDKs

Tips and resources for building Flow SDKs and client libraries. :wrench:

This repository defines guidelines, not rules. 
It aims to help you build and maintain a high-quality SDK Flow, 
but you should feel free to make design decisions that best language
or framework you are working in.

## Goals

### Consistency

Flow developers benefit from consistent functionality, 
terminology and behaviour across client libraries.
These guidelines document common terms and use cases, 
as well as test data to promote consistent behaviour across platforms.

### Accessibility

Good SDKs are well-documented and easy to discover. 
This repository includes documentation templates and shows how to 
automatically integrate your documentation into the Flow documentation website.

### Reliability

Users should trust that your SDK behaves as expected. 
The test case data in this repository are updated whenever new functionality is added to Flow,
and can help you ensure correct behaviour across your SDK functions.

### Community-driven

Contributions are welcome! 
The best libraries will be developed by experts from across the Flow community, 
and we hope to use this repository to collect best practices that can be shared by all.
